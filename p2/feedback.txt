Great job on phase two and a super cool project idea!! To answer some of your questions, while I am not sure if your research question is specific enough right now, there is definitely significant potential for interesting analyses and a bunch of routes to explore. A fair amount of your next steps will be to find these routes and narrow down your question a bit more. (Before I forget, you should definitely make a point about how Hopkins was a leader for publicizing covid data, so that may explain their rise in followers in March-ish. Also, with quarantine, many people probably increased the number of accounts they follow on Instagram in general). Perhaps, going along with this last point, I wonder if you can see how the number of followers these college accounts have changed at a different rate than that of other "celebrity-type" accounts, espcially during quarantine. Again, super interesting project w/ many possibilities! For the questions you had for me specifically, you should continue with your exploratory data analysis and see if you find something that really catches your eye -- then you may want to make that the focus of your research question! Preregistration of analysis means that we want to see this process you go through -- we don't just want to see the super cool results you get from your exploratory analysis or that conclusion you get from your analysis; rather, we want to see this process you go through to get these results. Final phase analysis is just the main analysis/es you perform, which is up to you. Perhaps some type of regression, clustering, maybe even a graph-based model you construct of the Instagram accounts and followers (you will learn more throughout the course to help you with this, so don't worry too much about these particular techniques for the time being). Good luck!!
