This can be observed in the data exploration graphs. We attempted to fix some of this (particularly range and rate of change) by recently scraping more data and ensuring that the beginning and ending dates had fully populated entries.\n",

    "3. Instagram statistics are not as granular as we would've liked (eg. `k` to denote thousand and `m` to denote million). As a result, there is some stepping that can be observed in the graphs (especially for Harvard and other Instagram accounts with high follower counts).\n",
    "3. Our dataset is 3-dimensional: Instagram handle, statistics, time. As a result, there is some information loss when collapsing it to 2D. In this phase, we chose to collapse statistics and time into one variable: summary statistics over time. This can be observed in the exploratory data analysis for our merged dataset."
