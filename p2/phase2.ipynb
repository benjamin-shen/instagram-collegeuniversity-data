For every university, there is a table of observations with rows being timestamped days from the past year and columns being the number of followers, following, and posts on the university's Instagram page. This dataset was created by Changyuan as a personal project starting last year, and has been autonomously collecting data ever since. The 70 Instagram accounts tracked were chosen by hand, so they are not necessarily representative of all universities. During certain time intervals, data was missing due to rate limiting or unexpected modifications to the structure of the scraped website. No preprocessing was done before the data was received and cleaned for this project, and no data was collected on accounts belonging to individual people, only institutions. Raw data is available in the GitHub repository."

More attributes are present in the full dataset, which was assembled by the US Department of Education as part of the College Scorecard Project. The College Scorecard Project is designed to increase transparency and help students and families compare postsecondary institutions. The data originates from federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information, reported to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). For many elements, data is processed and pooled across multiple years to reduce year to year variation in figures. Student-level data comes from the universities themselves or through recipients of federal student aid, who are likely aware that their anonymized statistics will be included as part of the institution's records. The raw College Scorecard data used in this project can be found at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/."

Since Instagram data exists by university, attribute, and time, we had to drop one to reasonably fit inside a 2D dataframe. As such, the data points for each university over the course of a year were compressed into their latest values and summary statistics. Merged data contains all columns in the Scorecard Data, plus columns for current and summary statistics of followers, following, and post count. The merged data only contains rows/observations for universities that we were able to map an Instagram account that we collected data to."

We think this is due to Instagram's rate limiting, and mishandling of rate-limiting errors when collecting this data, or changes to Instagram's website that persisted for a period of time and were then removed. This can be observed in the data exploration graphs. We attempted to fix some of this (particularly range and rate of change) by recently scraping more data and ensuring that the beginning and ending dates had fully populated entries.\n",
    "2. The Instagram handles are handpicked by Changyuan, and is thus not comprehensive. It is not necessarily representative of all types of colleges/universities in the U.S. For example, there tends to be more Colorado schools (where Changyuan is from).\n",
    "3. Instagram statistics are not as granular as we would've liked (eg. `k` to denote thousand and `m` to denote million). As a result, there is some stepping that can be observed in the graphs (especially for Harvard and other Instagram accounts with high follower counts).\n",
    "3. Our dataset is 3-dimensional: Instagram handle, statistics, time. As a result, there is some information loss when collapsing it to 2D. In this phase, we chose to collapse statistics and time into one variable: summary statistics over time. This can be observed in the exploratory data analysis for our merged dataset."
