    "As social media becomes ever more prevalent in our lives, companies and other institutions have needed to carve out an online presence. Universities are no exception to this, and the overwhelming majority of colleges have their own Instagram accounts in 2020. But how much do these Instagram accounts reflect the schools behind them? We sought to answer questions like this by analyzing the Instagram followers/following/post counts of 70 or so universities, comparing them to descriptive attributes such as student body size and acceptance rate.\n",

    "Instagram data was collected per-university. For every university, there is a table of observations with rows being timestamped days from the past year and columns being the number of followers, following, and posts on the university's Instagram page. This dataset was created by Changyuan as a personal project starting last year, and has been autonomously collecting data ever since. The 70 Instagram accounts tracked were chosen by hand, so they are not necessarily representative of all universities. During certain time intervals, data was missing due to rate limiting or unexpected modifications to the structure of the scraped website. No preprocessing was done before the data was received and cleaned for this project, and no data was collected on accounts belonging to individual people, only institutions. Raw data is available in the source code (below)."

The rows are universities, and the columns are admission rate, SAT score, cost of attendance, average income, median income, size of student population, latitude, longitude, city, name, ownership (private/public), region, state, locale type, and locale size. More attributes are present in the full dataset, which was assembled by the US Department of Education as part of the College Scorecard Project. The College Scorecard Project is designed to increase transparency and help students and families compare postsecondary institutions. The data originates from federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information, reported to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). For many elements, data is processed and pooled across multiple years to reduce year to year variation in figures. Student-level data comes from the universities themselves or through recipients of federal student aid, who are likely aware that their anonymized statistics will be included as part of the institution's records. The raw College Scorecard data used in this project can be found at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/."

    "Merged data is a combination of the Instagram Data and Scorecard Data. It is a smaller dataset, as it only contains the subset of universities that we collected Instagram data for over the past year. All universities that were scraped are present in the Scorecard data. Since Instagram data exists by university, attribute, and time, we had to drop one to reasonably fit inside a 2D dataframe. As such, the data points for each university over the course of a year were compressed into their latest values and summary statistics. Merged data contains all columns in the Scorecard Data, plus columns for current and summary statistics of followers, following, and post count. The merged data only contains rows/observations for universities that we were able to map an Instagram account that we collected data to. This final version of the cleaned data is in [`instagram_details.csv`](../data/instagram_details.csv)."

Their follower count shot up starting in March, which coincidentally lines up with a shift in their Instagram posts' aesthetic to stress-relieving pictures (starting after [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-FlWBFhSrk/)).\n",

    "### Instagram Data\n",
    "1. We have chunks of missing or corrupt data. We think this is due to Instagram's rate limiting, and mishandling of rate-limiting errors when collecting this data, or changes to Instagram's website that persisted for a period of time and were then removed. This can be observed in the data exploration graphs. We dealt with this (particularly range and rate of change) by recently scraping more data and ensuring that the beginning and ending dates had fully populated entries.\n",
    "2. The Instagram handles are handpicked by Changyuan, and is thus not comprehensive. It is not necessarily representative of all types of colleges/universities in the U.S. For example, there tends to be more Colorado schools (where Changyuan is from).\n",
    "3. Instagram statistics are not as granular as we would've liked (eg. `k` to denote thousand and `m` to denote million). As a result, there is some stepping that can be observed in the graphs (especially for Harvard and other Instagram accounts with high follower counts). If we were to do this again, we would either scrape from a third-party site (like https://instastatistics.com/) or scrape HTML tag metadata instead of the text.\n",
    "3. Our dataset is 3-dimensional: Instagram handle, statistics, time. As a result, there is some information loss when collapsing it to 2D. In this phase, we chose to collapse statistics and time into one variable: summary statistics over time. This can be observed in the exploratory data analysis for our merged dataset. An alternative approach, as suggested by our mentor William, would be to use [other dimensionality reduction techniques](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/dimensionality-reduction-techniques-python/). We decided against this since it was outside the scope of the class and would take more time than we had to understand everything from scratch."

Our primary goal was to find something interesting (significant or not), which is entirely subjective and could have led to some personal bias in our analysis.\n",
    "2. Our sample size is extremely small (~70 institutions) compared to what our project is attempting to generalize to (four-year colleges and universities in the U.S.). So, all our findings, including insignificance, should be taken with a grain of salt."
