Category: Introduction
The introduction is satisfactory but doesn't really seem to explain the applications of what they're doing or why it is important to them at all.  

Category: Data Description
Data description again is normal, nothing special but it covers all the bases.

Category: Preregistration Statement
The prereg statements are not that developed.  The analyses could be performed, but there is no mention of any real world application and the statements are extremely succint.

Category: Data analysis
From what I can tell, the team ran the numbers the right way.  Data analysis itself was good. However, the presentation of the data was a bit sloppy (4 different notebooks) which made it difficult to easily read each section of data.  Also there was old code in the notebook that had not been removed.

Category: Interpretations and Conclusions
Interpretations were satisfactory.  They correctly described the outcome of their data in a way that made sense.  They also somewhat mentioned an application of the data to the real world but there was not a lot of detail given.

Category: Limitations
Limitations were good. They accurately described problems they ran into and the numerous limitations they operated under.

I'm not sure why but I was given this project twice to review.  Overall a good job given the limitations placed upon the data and what you could do with it! :)
