You have some really interesting ideas -- great job!

1. How much data is "enough"?

You should be able to extend your conclusions from your sample to a wider population (one high school in the US can't generalize to all of them). If you can confidently say that you have enough data, you should be fine

2. How feasible is the amount of data for these ideas?

Very feasible

3. Do you see any difficulties we may encounter with these ideas?

It seems like getting your data may be a bit difficult, but your ideas definitely have a lot of potential. Also, your data may wind up being a bit messy

4. How interesting (to you) are these ideas?

I really like them!

5. Are there specific practices to web scrape data without introducing bias?

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "introducing bias"... (are you trying to get a more random sample?)

Good luck! If you have any questions, feel free to email me at wjb239@cornell.edu
